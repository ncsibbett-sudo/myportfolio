## Background

I’m a product-minded builder with a passion for solving real problems through thoughtful, user-centered design. While in BYU’s Sandbox program, I led the development and go-to-market efforts for an asset management tool tailored to private equity firms. Over the course of a year, I worked closely with end users to identify pain points, translate insights into product requirements, and deliver solutions that improved their workflows.

This experience sharpened my skills in product discovery, user research, stakeholder communication, and iterative development. I thrive at the intersection of user needs, business goals, and technical feasibility—and I’m energized by the challenge of turning complex problems into intuitive products.
